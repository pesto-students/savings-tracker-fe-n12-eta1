# Installation
. Clone the repo
    ```sh
    https://github.com/pesto-students/savings-tracker-fe-n12-eta1
    ```
2. Set environment variables

PORT=3000
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=</br>
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=</br>
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=sa</br>
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=</br>
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=</br>
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=</br>
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3000 

3. Install NPM packages
    ```sh
    cd savings-tracker-fe-n12-eta1 && npm install
    ```
4. Run
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
5. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser

6. Run Test cases
    ```sh
    npm test
    ```
7. Run Build
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```
7. Run Eject
    ```sh
    npm run eject
    ```
<br/>

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Technology Stack
We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
